# ESP32 Envi Sensor

## Device Description

The Envi Sensor (like it or not, that's its name) is a temperature and humidity reading device powered by an ESP32 board.

Readings are grabbed every 30 seconds and displayed on the Nokia 5110 lcd screen;
the switch allows the user to choose among three different views:

1. show current temperature and humidity
2. show max, min, and median temperature among the last 120 readings (last hour)
3. show max, min, and median humidity among the last 120 readings (last hour)

Finally, the Envi Sensor acts as a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) GATT Server, from which a smartphone (or any BLE-enabled device) can read the current temperature and humidity.

## Bill of Materials

- ESP32-DevKitC V4

  - features two 32-bit CPU cores, 4MB Flash, 520KB SRAM, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth LE,
    and a whole bunch of peripherals

- SHT21 Humidity and Temperature Sensor (a GY-21 module in my case), communicating over I2C

- Nokia 5110 Display, communicating over SPI

- Normally Open Push Button, set up in negative logic using the ESP32 internal pull-up resistor

- ESP-Prog JTAG Adapter (optional, useful for development)

- Breadboard and cables as usual

## Device Description

## Tasks Overview

To understand how the different parts of the system work with each other, it's useful to know what each FreeRTOS Task is responsible for:

- `tt_read_sensor`: periodically reads temperature and humidity from the SHT21 sensor and writes them to the binary queues `binqueue_ble` and `binqueue_lcd`

- `tt_update_ble`: waits for `binqueue_ble` to hold new data, gets it, and updates the temperature/humidity BLE GATT characteristics

- `tt_update_lcd_ring_buffer`: waits for `binqueue_ble` to hold new data, gets it, and writes it to the ring-buffers `ringbuf_lcd_temperature` and `ringbuf_lcd_humidity`, which hold the last 120 readings

- `tt_read_lcd_switch`: waits from a falling edge, debounces the switch, increments the counter `lcd_view`, and signals the binary semaphore `binsemaphore_lcd_view`

- `tt_refresh_lcd_view`: waits for `binsemaphore_lcd_view`, reads the updated counter `lcd_view`, and renders the new view on the lcd

In addition:

- the module `ble_manager` takes care of the entire Bluetooth setup, abstracting all the details from `tt_update_ble`

- the module `lcd_manager` takes care of rendering the views using the data from `ringbuf_lcd_temperature` and `ringbuf_lcd_humidity`

TODO LORIS: who's responsible to keep the lcd views updated, when new sensor data come in?

## Hardware Connection

The connection between ESP Board and the other components is as follows:

The JTAG Adapter is of course be removed after development.

## External Libraries

- [sht21](https://github.com/dehre/sht21) - driver for the temperature and humidity sensor, which I wrote myself

- [ssd1306](https://github.com/lexus2k/ssd1306) - driver for the Nokia 5110 display

## BLE Setup

The SHT21 sensor readings are advertised over BLE as a GATT Environmental Sensing Service (GATT Assigned Number 0x181A) with two GATT Characteristics.
The service has two Characteristics, one representing temperature (0x2A6E) and one representing Humidity (0x2A6F).

Each GATT Characteristic defines how the data should be represented:

- _Temperature_

The data type is a 16-bit signed integer.
Unit is degrees Celsius with a resolution of 0.01 degrees Celsius.
Allowed range is: -273.15 to 327.67.
A value of 0x8000 represents 'value is not known'.
All other values are prohibited.
See `GATT Specification Supplement Datasheet Page 223 Section 3.204`.

- _Humidity_

The data type is a 16-bit unsigned integer.
Unit is in percent with a resolution of 0.01 percent.
Allowed range is: 0.00 to 100.00
A value of 0xFFFF represents 'value is not known'.
All other values are prohibited.
See `GATT Specification Supplement Datasheet Page 223 Section 3.204`.

Using the `sht21` library, both temperature and humidity are retrieved as floating point numbers.
The Temperature GATT Characteristic, however, requires a signed 16-bit value (-32768 32767), so the captured value (e.g. 9.87Â°C) is multiplied by 100, then converted to an integer (e.g. 987).  
Similar reasoning goes for the Humidity GATT Characteristic.

## BLE Events Lifecycle

This log shows the order in which BLE events are triggered when a BLE-client (i.e. smartphone) connects to the ESP32. It might be useful for debugging.
